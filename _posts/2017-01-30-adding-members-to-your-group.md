Coaches can use join codes to add colleagues or students to their team as members. Each group on the team is automatically assigned its own join code. When you want someone to join your team, you would supply them either with your group's join code or with the group's join URL. This information allows them to join the site and your team. They are also automatically added to your group.
<h2>Identifying your group's join code</h2>
To look up your group's join code, you would first click on “Team Groups,” then click on “Invite” next to the group you would like to add members to. You will land on a page which gives you three options: Invite via URL, invite via join code, or add existing members.
<h2>Distributing your group's Join Code/URL</h2>
Depending on your preference, you can copy either the join code or the URL to your clipboard, and then past it into an email, or an internal webpage you would use to distribute the information to your member(s). Or, if you want to add existing members of your team to your group, choose the third choice which takes you to the Edit page for your group. From that group, you will be able to add existing members.
