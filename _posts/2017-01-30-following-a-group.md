Coaches can keep tabs on student progress in the path by following the groups that they belong to. You automatically follow any new groups that you create yourself.
<h3>Following an existing Group</h3>
Any groups which contain at least one member will be listed under the “Other Groups” section on the Groups page. The groups that you follow will be listed at the top of the page under “My Groups.” When you want to follow a group, click on the “follow” button located to the left of its title.
